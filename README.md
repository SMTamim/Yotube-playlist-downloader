The default download location is in "C:\Users\Public\Downloads" folder(change can be done by modifying the script).

The script will ask you to create a folder. If a folder exist you can either use that or create a new one in the mentioned directory.

Then you will have to give the youtube playlist link you want to download and how many videos you wanna download from there.

After that the program will start downloading and if it finds duplicate in the folder it will skip it.
